## About

This optimizes your Roblox client's FVars. Uses RFO's flags provided in their discord. Click [here](https://github.com/fheahdythdr/ClientFlagOptimizer/releases) to download the latest installer.

If any errors happen, create an issue and try to explain what happened or provide a video of what happened.

I will very likely not be updating any FVars at the moment, however you can create custom FVar jsons.

Will be migrating to [this other repo](https://github.com/fheahdythdr/JCO) soon, as RFO's JS api is now a thing.

JCO will still be using a C++ frontend to install everything needed and be able to go into the tray, because there's no real way to do so in NodeJS as far as I know.

## Using custom URLS

Simply type url in the console, and enter the raw .json url you have after being prompted to enter one.

It has to be the raw URL that gives the raw JSON, like raw github urls.

If you want some configs, go to [my fflag repo](https://github.com/fheahdythdr/fflags)

If you want to use local settings, just do file:///path/to/json (ex. file:///C:\CFO\custom_settings.json)

You are able to directly clone a raw JSON url for ease of use by typing mcsf and entering a URL.
