-- todo --

link libraries to exe
figure out how to detect file creation, then detect file changes if said file's name is custom_url.txt

-- in progress --



-- finished --

learn more c++ so i can make changing urls bound to a key in the console

-- cancelled/stopped + reason --

implement the 3 keys you can press in src repo's latest js files (i - install, u - uninstall, q - quit), reason: not necessary, installer can already be quit with the X in the top right, and RCO2 itself can be stopped with alt f4
